    <section>
      <h2>Apache and the Rise of Open Source</h2>
      <p>Apache HTTP Server, introduced in 1995, rapidly became the most popular server software due to its open-source model, modular design, and extensive community support. It formed the basis of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) and supported scalable, multi-platform websites through the 2000s. Apache introduced critical features such as .htaccess control, mod_rewrite, and logging tools, which gave developers robust control over website behavior.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>The Nginx Revolution</h2>
      <p>Launched in 2004, Nginx addressed Apache’s performance bottlenecks by introducing a non-blocking, event-driven architecture. Created by Igor Sysoev, Nginx could handle thousands of simultaneous connections with low memory usage, making it ideal for high-traffic sites. Its adoption by companies like Netflix, Dropbox, and WordPress.com signaled a new era of efficient and scalable web hosting.</p>

      Server Evolution Section:
      - Covers IIS, LiteSpeed, Caddy, and the move to virtualization and containers.

    <section>
      <h2>Server Evolution and Diversification</h2>
      <p>Microsoft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) became widely adopted in corporate networks using Windows Server. It integrated seamlessly with ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL Server. Concurrently, new players like LiteSpeed introduced advanced caching for CMS platforms like WordPress, and Caddy Server simplified HTTPS setup with automatic certificate provisioning.</p>
      <p>By the 2010s, web server deployment shifted towards virtualization and containerization, driven by the rise of cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. These platforms enabled flexible, on-demand scaling, allowing developers to deploy web servers inside containers using Docker and orchestrate them using Kubernetes.</p>

      Cloud Era Section:
      - Describes the impact of cloud-native and serverless architectures.
    -->
    <section>
      <h2>Web Servers in the Cloud Era</h2>
      <p>Cloud-native architectures redefined how web servers are deployed and managed. Instead of static infrastructure, modern environments use dynamic, auto-scaling instances to respond to traffic demand. Serverless models further abstract server management entirely, letting developers focus on code while the platform handles provisioning and scaling. Examples include AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions.</p>
