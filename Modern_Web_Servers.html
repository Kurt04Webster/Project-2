    <h1>Modern Web Servers</h1>
    <h2>Current Technologies</h2>
    <p>Apache HTTP Server and Nginx dominate the web server landscape, with Microsoft IIS also serving enterprise environments. Other modern alternatives include LiteSpeed and Caddy Server.</p>
    <p>Apache remains favored for its open-source flexibility, while Nginx is preferred for handling large volumes of concurrent traffic efficiently.</p>
    <p>IIS integrates seamlessly with Microsoft technologies, making it ideal for Windows-based enterprise environments. LiteSpeed offers proprietary performance advantages for WordPress and PHP-heavy sites, and Caddy simplifies HTTPS configuration with automatic certificates.</p>
