        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="intro-box">The World Wide Web (WWW), a core feature of the modern internet, depends on several key technologies to operate efficiently. Among the most critical is the web server. A web server is responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing them, and delivering the appropriate web content to users across the globe. This process is foundational to the accessibility of all websites and web applications.</p>
        <p class="intro-box">Technically, a web server is both hardware and software. The hardware is a physical computer that stores website files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and multimedia. The software is the server application that interprets browser requests and serves responses. Some of the most widely used server applications include Apache, Nginx, IIS, and newer tools like LiteSpeed and Caddy.</p>
        <p class="intro-box">Over time, web server technology has evolved from simple static file delivery to dynamic, cloud-integrated, containerized environments capable of scaling to meet the needs of billions of users. Today’s servers operate within complex infrastructure that includes reverse proxies, databases, edge computing, and AI-based automation. This website explores the history, modern landscape, and future of web servers, highlighting key products, organizations, and innovations shaping the field.</p>
